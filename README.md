# TradeRepublic PDF Renaming

## Getting started

This repository is currently limited to use under Windows and takes into account the current structure of TradeRepublic invoices. Also, this script works only for German-language invoices.

### Required Software and Tools

* [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/)

### Usage

To use this code, the exported invoices are saved to the Input folder. Then, running run.bat will cause the PDFs to be renamed and moved to the Output folder.
**Attention:** Please make sure that no PDF is open during execution.
